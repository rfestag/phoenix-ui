# What is a module?

In Phoenix UI, a module is a reducer-based React context and a common set of actions for affecting the state.
It is modeled after Redux in that you dispatch the actions to the reducer. A module may also provide
some common components that are already integrated with the context. Others may simply provide common
state and actions to be used by others.

# Creating a context

You can use `createContext` to wrap a React context with a reducer and default state. It should be used
with all modules

Generally, you will start by creating a file that defines actions

```javascript title="actions.js"
export const INCREMENT = "INCREMENT";
export const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });
```

Then you will use `createContext` to handle the boilerplate. Simply define
some default state and a reducer function.

```javascript title="context.js"
import { createContext } from "@phoenix-ui/core"
import { INCREMENT } from "./actions"

const DEFAULT_STATE = {count: 0}
const reducer = (state, { type, payload }) => {
  switch type {
    case INCREMENT: {
      return {...state, count: state.count+1}
    }
  }
  return state
}

export const [MyContext, MyContextProvider, MyContextConsumer] = createContext(
  reducer,
  DEFAULT_STATE
)
```

In your widgets, use the actions you defined and the `dispatch` function to
update the state.

```javascript title="Widet.jsx"
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { increment } from "./actions";

export const Widget = () => {
  const { state, dispatch } = useContext(MyContext);
  const { count } = state;
  return <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>{count}</button>;
};
```

In order to use the module's reducer, you need to use the
generated Provider instead of the context's default provider

```javascript title="App.jsx"
import { MyContextProvider } from "./context";
export const App = () => (
  <div>
    <MyContextProvider initialState={{ count: 1 }}>
      <Widget />
    </MyContextProvider>
  </div>
);
```
